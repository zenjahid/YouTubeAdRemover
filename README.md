2. **Install the Script**:
   [Click Here and Press Install](Youtube-Ad-blocker-Reminder-Remover.user.js?raw=True).

3. **Enable the Script**:
   Enable the script by clicking the switch next to the script name in the Tampermonkey Dashboard.

4. **Disable your adblocker**:
   Whitelist YouTube on any Chrome extensions that block ads or any third-party things that disable ads. Don't worry; our script removes ads on YouTube.

Note: This also allows you to watch videos when your video player is banned from using an adblock.
